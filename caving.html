  <title>Paul Dold Memorial Artificial Cave Project</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The artificial cave project is a vision inspired by the late Paul Dold, who sadly lost his life in 2016. Paul was a very active member of Horsham District Scouts and was himself a Cub, Scout, Venture Scout, Leader and Group Scout Leader. Paul was also a member of the South East Cave Rescue Organisation (SECRO) and a proud recipient of the Jubilee medal for services to caving. Scouting introduced Paul to caving and Paul dreamt of building a training facility to introduce and teach caving to the next generation of scouts.">

          <p>Caving – also known as spelunking in the United States and Canada and potholing in the United Kingdom and Ireland – is the recreational pastime of exploring wild (generally non-commercial) cave systems. In contrast, speleology is the scientific study of caves and the cave environment.
