  <title>Paul Dold Memorial Artificial Cave Project</title>
  <meta name="description" content="The artificial cave project is a vision inspired by the late Paul Dold, who sadly lost his life in 2016. Paul was a very active member of Horsham District Scouts and was himself a Cub, Scout, Venture Scout, Leader and Group Scout Leader. Paul was also a member of the South East Cave Rescue Organisation (SECRO) and a proud recipient of the Jubilee medal for services to caving. Scouting introduced Paul to caving and Paul dreamt of building a training facility to introduce and teach caving to the next generation of scouts.">

          <p>Artificial Caving Systems provide a fun and exciting replication of real caving but in a safe and controlled environment. Similar to indoor climbing walls, artificial caving systems aim to educate, inspire and excite a new generation of subterranean explorers as well as make caving more accessible to those who otherwise would not get a chance to participate. - <a href="http://www.hangfastadventure.com/cave-fast-artificial-caving/cave-fast">Hangfast</a></p>
