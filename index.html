          <a class="button button-primary" href="https://wonderful.org/fundraiser/pauldoldmemorialartificialcaveproject-33f78d15">Donate!</a>
          <p>The artificial cave project is a vision inspired by the late Paul Dold, who sadly lost his life in 2016. Paul was a very active member of Horsham District Scouts and was himself a Cub, Scout, Venture Scout, Leader and Group Scout Leader. Paul was also a member of the South East Cave Rescue Organisation (SECRO) and a proud recipient of the Jubilee medal for services to caving. Scouting introduced Paul to caving and Paul dreamt of building a training facility to introduce and teach caving to the next generation of scouts.</p>
        
          <h5>Mission and Project Plan</h5>
          <p>Our mission is to build an Artificial cave system at the Horsham District Scout Campsite in memory of Paul. Phase One has now been completed with planning permission obtained in 2018 and the project fully costed.</p>
          <p>We are now fundraising to support the implementation of the next two phases. Phase Two involves ground works and construction of the metal building and Phase Three involves the purchase and installation of the specialist Artificial cave system from one of the UK's leading suppliers.</p>

          <h5>Fundraising Plan</h5>
          <p>The project is costed at £110k, with approximately £20k already raised. We aim to raise funds through a wide range of fun and innovative individual and Group activities and by applying for grants, charitable donations and corporate sponsorship.</p>
          <p>This project will provide Horsham District Scouts with the opportunity to encourage young people to challenge themselves cognitively, emotionally and physically and to develop partnerships and links with other local communities and services.</p>
